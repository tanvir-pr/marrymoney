# MongoDB Aggregation Documentation

## Overview
MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for data processing and analysis, allowing you to transform and summarize data in a variety of ways. Aggregations are operations that process data records and return computed results. They are often used to group values from multiple documents together, perform operations on the grouped data, and return a single result.

## Aggregation Pipeline
The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation, modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result. Each stage in the pipeline performs an operation on the input documents and passes the results to the next stage.

### Basic Syntax
```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $stage1: { /* stage1 options */ }},
  { $stage2: { /* stage2 options */ }},
  // More stages as needed
])
```
# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Guide

## Common Aggregation Stages

### $match
Filters documents based on specified conditions.

```javascript
{ $match: { status: "A" } }
```

## $group
Groups documents by a specified identifier and applies accumulator expressions to each group.

```javascript
{ 
  $group: {
    _id: "$field",
    total: { $sum: "$amount" }
  }
}
```
## $project
The `$project` stage reshapes documents by adding or removing fields. It allows you to specify which fields to include or exclude in the output documents, along with computed fields using expressions.

### Example:
```javascript
{ 
  $project: {
    name: 1,
    total: { $sum: "$items.price" }
  }
}
```
## $sort
The `$sort` stage sorts input documents based on the specified criteria. It's useful for ordering documents based on one or more fields, either ascending or descending.

## Example: 
```javascript
{ $sort: { total: -1 } }
```
## $limit
Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage.

```javascript
{ $limit: 5 }
```
## $lookup
Performs a left outer join with another collection.

```javascript
{
  $lookup: {
    from: "otherCollection",
    localField: "localField",
    foreignField: "foreignField",
    as: "fromItems"
  }
}
```
# Example Aggregation Pipeline: Calculate Total Sales by Category

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { 
      date: { $gte: ISODate("2024-01-01"), $lt: ISODate("2025-01-01") }
    } 
  },
  { 
    $group: {
      _id: "$category",
      totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" }
    } 
  },
  { 
    $sort: { totalSales: -1 } 
  }
])
```
# $unwind

Deconstructs an array field into separate documents.

```javascript
{ $unwind: "$items" }
```
# $addFields

Adds new fields to documents.

```javascript
{ 
  $addFields: {
    totalAfterDiscount: { $subtract: ["$total", "$discount"] }
  } 
}
```
This example calculates a new field totalAfterDiscount by subtracting the value of the field discount from the value of the field total.
# $redact

Controls document field visibility.

```javascript
{
  $redact: {
    $cond: {
      if: { $eq: ["$status", "A"] },
      then: "$$KEEP",
      else: "$$PRUNE"
    }
  }
}
```
This example controls the visibility of document fields based on the value of the status field. If the status field is equal to "A", the document is kept ($$KEEP), otherwise it's pruned ($$PRUNE).
# $out

Writes aggregation results to a specified collection.

```javascript
{ $out: "resultCollection" }
```
This stage saves the results of the aggregation pipeline to a new collection named "resultCollection".
# Best Practices

- **Indexing:** Ensure indexing on fields used in $match, $group, and $lookup stages for better performance.
- **Pipeline Optimization:** Place $match and $sort stages early in the pipeline to reduce document processing.
- **Stage Limits:** Be aware of memory limitations; consider breaking complex pipelines into multiple stages or using $merge.

# Conclusion

MongoDB's aggregation framework is versatile and powerful, allowing for complex data transformations and analyses. Mastering the various stages and techniques enables efficient data processing and valuable insights extraction.
